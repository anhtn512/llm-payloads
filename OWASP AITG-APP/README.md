# OWASP AITG

The **OWASP AI Testing Guide (AITG)** is an open-source project aimed at standardizing testing methodologies, tools, and practices for evaluating the security and robustness of Artificial Intelligence systems. This repository provides practical resources, templates, and documentation to help red teamers, security researchers, and developers test and assess LLMs and AI-powered applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Are the Payloads?

Each AITG-APP-XX.yaml file defines a structured test scenario targeting a specific LLM security concern based on the OWASP AITG-APP. These include a system prompt designed for an LLM judge, which acts as a consistent evaluator for whether the modelâ€™s behavior violates a given control.

These YAML files can be integrated into red teaming pipelines, model eval frameworks, or used manually by analysts for step-by-step testing.

## ðŸ“š Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/owasp-aitg.git
   cd owasp-aitg
   ```

2. Explore the YAML files (`AITG-APP-*.yaml`) for specific test cases and guidelines.
